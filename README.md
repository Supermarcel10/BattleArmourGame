# <u>Game *"Battle Armour"*</u>

## <u>Concept</u>

This game is heavily inspired on the arcade game [Tank Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Battalion), created by Namco, released in 1980.
The original game was created and originally released in Japan under the name of "タンクバタリアン (Tanku Batarian)". A year later it was released to the US market.

The game was later re-released with drastic improvements under the name of [Battle City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City) as well as [Tank Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Force).

This project will be a general recreation of the original 1980 game in Java.
The idea is that the game runs on Windows, Mac and Linux with no emulation required.

My version will be implementing something similar to the original game, with a smoother FPS and smoother movement.
I will also make custom perks and balance the game in the way I believe it is difficult enough to be engaging, but still physically doable.
